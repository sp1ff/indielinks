* Introduction

Indielinks brings [[https://web.archive.org/web/20080906021806/http://delicious.com/][del.icio.us]]-style bookmarks to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse][Fediverse]].
* License

Indielinks is released under the [[https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html][GPL v3.0]].
* Pre-requisites

At thish time, Indielinks is only available as source. Therefore, the Rust [[https://rustup.rs/][toolchain]] is required. To run Indielinks locally, you'll either need to have [[https://www.scylladb.com/][ScyllaDB]] installed, or [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]] (to pull run ScyllaDB images). To run Indielinks in AWS, you'll need an AWS account.
* Installation

Coming.
* Status & Roadmap

I've done some prototyping (see the =prototype= branch), but this is first code. I plan on building-out the documentation quite a bit beyond what's available now, starting here.
