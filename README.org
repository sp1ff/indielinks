* Introduction

indielinks brings [[https://web.archive.org/web/20080906021806/http://delicious.com/][del.icio.us]]-style social bookmarking to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse][Fediverse]].

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)][del.icio.us]] was a web service in the aughts & early teens to which you could not only upload your bookmarks, but share them, discuss them and discover content shared by others (AKA "social bookmarking"). The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse][Fediverse]] is a collection of decentralized social networking services that federate with one another over the [[https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/][ActivityPub]] protocol; the one you've mostly likely heard of is [[https://joinmastodon.org/][Mastodon]].

indielinks is a web service that offers social bookmarking

but it's federated: when you add a (public) link

it will show up in your followers' Mastodon feeds, where they can comment, boost & re-post.

* License

indielinks is released under the [[https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html][GPL v3.0]].
* Pre-requisites

At this time, indielinks is only available as source. Therefore, the Rust stable [[https://rustup.rs/][toolchain]] is required. To run indielinks locally, you'll either need to have [[https://www.scylladb.com/][ScyllaDB]] installed, or [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]] (to pull & run ScyllaDB images). The integration tests require [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]], as well as [[https://www.haproxy.org/][haproxy]]. You'll want [[https://trunkrs.dev/][trunk]] for building & working on the frontend. The [[INSTALL.org]] file has details.
* Installation

Presently, indielinks can only be installed locally, running against ScyllaDB, by hand. See [[INSTALL.org]] for details.
* Status & Roadmap

I'm using indielinks today, running locally on bare metal to save bookmarks & maintain reading lists. That said, it's early code, and I haven't even stood-up the first public instance, yet. I've built out the old del.icio.us API, a user management API, (most of) the ActivityPub support on the backend, have made an indielinks cluster into a Raft consensus cluster (in anticipation of caching), and am currently working on a web frontend.

Outside of installation, the frontend is probably the most lacking: it's incomplete, and generally looks like it was written, well, by a backend developer.

I've only recently made this project public. You can read more about the project & goals [[https://www.unwoundstack.com/blog/indielinks.html][here]]. I presented on the project at the [[https://www.meetup.com/vancouver-rust/events/307731034/][Vancouver Rust Meetup]].

Beyond packaging and the frontend, my next focus will be on deploying to the cloud & making an instance available, perhaps publicly, perhaps by invitation.

In the meantime, comments, suggestions and contributions are welcome, on [[https://indieweb.social/@sp1ff][Mastodon]], in the [[https://github.com/sp1ff/indielinks/issues][issues]] or at [[mailto:sp1ff@pobox.com][sp1ff@pobox.com]]. In particular, if you're a frontend developer who'd be interested in helping out, I'd love to hear from you.
