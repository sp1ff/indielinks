#+STARTUP: overview

* Introduction

indielinks-fe is a web frontend for [[file://../README][indielinks]].
* License

Indielinks is released under the [[https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html][GPL v3.0]].
* Pre-requisites

In addition to the workspace [[file:/README*Pre-requisites][prerequisites]], this project requires [[https://trunkrs.dev/][trunk]] which can be installed with:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  cargo install trunk
#+END_SRC

You'll also need to have the =wasm32-unknown-unknown= target available in your Rust toolchain:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
#+END_SRC
* Installation

Coming.
* Status & Roadmap

This is first code; not merely with respect to the indielinks-fe project, but my first web frontend code, altogether.
